    <p> Hello welcome to my page. I did not know what to write this about and I was doing this while listening to music so I was like omg perfect topic. I will always bring up my obsession with Taylor Swift so this is the perfect opportunity. </p>

    <h1> Death by a Thousand Cuts </h1>
    <h2> By Taylor Swift </h2>
     <pre> Saying goodbye is death by a thousand cuts
Flashbacks waking me up
I get drunk, but it's not enough
'Cause the morning comes and you're not my baby
I look through the windows of this love
Even though we boarded them up
Chandelier's still flickering here
'Cause I can't pretend it's ok when it's not
It's death by a thousand cuts
I dress to kill my time
I take the long way home
I ask the traffic lights if it'll be all right
They say, "I don't know"
And what once was ours is no one's now
I see you everywhere
The only thing we share
Is this small town
You said it was a great love
One for the ages
But if the story's over
Why am I still writing pages?
'Cause saying goodbye is death by a thousand cuts
Flashbacks waking me up
I get drunk, but it's not enough
'Cause the morning comes and you're not my baby
I look through the windows of this love
Even though we boarded them up
Chandelier still flickering here
'Cause I can't pretend it's okay when it's not
It's death by a thousand cuts
       &nbsp 
My heart, my hips, my body, my love
Trying to find a part of me that you didn't touch
Gave up on me like I was a bad drug
Now I'm searching for signs in a haunted club
Our songs, our films, united we stand
Our country, guess it was a lawless land
Quiet my fears with the touch of your hand
Paper cut stings from our paper thin plans
My time, my wine, my spirit, my trust
Trying to find a part of me you didn't take up
Gave you too much but it wasn't enough
But I'll be all right, it's just a thousand cuts
I get drunk but it's not enough
'Cause you're not my baby
I look through the windows of this love
Even though we boarded them up
Chandelier's still flickering here
'Cause I can't pretend it's ok when it's not
No, it's not
It's death by a thousand cuts (you didn't touch)
Trying to find a part of me that you didn't touch
My body, my love, my trust (it's death by a thousand cuts)
But it wasn't enough, it wasn't enough, no, no
I take the long way home
I ask the traffic lights if it'll be all right
They say, "I don't know" </pre>
