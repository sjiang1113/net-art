    Net Activism 
</h1>
<h3> 
    Over the past few years, there have been a variety of social movements to fight for justice, equality and change. While many took to the streets, many artists have used their creative minds to spread awareness through murals, posters and social media. Their eye-catching colorful pieces encapsulate a deeper meaning of the change that needs to occur. Art has always been a medium to communicate ideas to others. Different artists from all around the world have created beautiful pieces displaying their fight against injustice, oppressive regimes and authoritarian governments. The internet has allowed for the art pieces to reach a variety of audiences, allowing for more people to learn about the social movement. For some, it may be hard to understand social movements through reading the news. However, through art pieces, anyone of any age can enjoy and have some understanding. All of the following pieces have some social movement tied into the art and the idea of spreading awareness.

During the 2016 election, an artist named RaDia Santana began a system that provided free meals to Black and Brown communities. This project incorporated art as well as helping those in need. It also highlighted the economic inequalities and brought light to the gap between moneyâ€™s symbolic and material function. While there are millionaires who fly private jets, there are millions of people not knowing where their next meal will come from. By creating this project, the artist hoped to bring awareness to those people and provide a little relief for them.

This is a moderation of Counter-Strike, the video game. This website was created for the purpose of demonstrating the possibility of activism in video games. When thinking of video games, usually the idea of spreading awareness is not the first thing that comes to mind. However, this game includes sprays that spread anti-war messages and the idea of peace, which is a little ironic coming from a shooting game. In my opinion, that just makes the whole message even better and allows for this message to be spread to those who do enjoy shooting guns in video games.

During 1996-1997, net art was emerging and many artists were excited by this new concept. There was a competition held for net art and artists were allowed to submit their work in hopes of being a part of a virtual extension of a museum. However, The top 3 awards were given to all men. When Cornelia Sollfrank revealed that she created three hundred fake female artists and submitted work, it raised questions about the net art and its traditional views. This art exhibition spread awareness of the gender inequalities and fought for more women inclusivity.
